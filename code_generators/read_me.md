## Info

This document contains some widely used template generation instructions.
The generators are built with [mason](https://docs.brickhub.dev/) so first mason should be installed. Then all the bricks should be installed in the [mason](https://docs.brickhub.dev/) and after you install custom generator (brick) you can start generating the code making bricks.

You can read the documetation of the [mason](https://docs.brickhub.dev/) on: https://docs.brickhub.dev/

## Usage

For initialization use:
`mason add -g remote_brick --path code_generators/bricks/remote_brick`
`mason add -g local_brick --path code_generators/bricks/local_brick`

For creation use:
`mason make remote_brick`
`mason make local_brick`
