## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-05-09 | Module named `fuzzy_vault` | Consistent with `fuzzzy_seal`, `fuzzy_auth`, `fuzzy_basics` naming |
| 2026-05-09 | Encrypted blobs on file system, metadata in Isar | Better performance, atomic writes, multi-directory support |
| 2026-05-09 | Custom password = double encryption (custom + master) | Master password always required; custom password is additive |
| 2026-05-09 | Export decrypts from master key, re-encrypts with export password | Simpler cross-device workflow — user only needs export password to import |
| 2026-05-09 | Rich text editor built from scratch (no external package) | Minimal dependency footprint; full control; offline-only constraint |
| 2026-05-09 | Default group "General" is undeletable | Ensures items always have a home; prevents orphans |
| 2026-05-09 | Metadata (titles, tags) stored unencrypted in Isar | Required for fast search/indexing; content is encrypted |

## Resolved Questions

| # | Question | Status | Resolution |
|---|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Should titles be encrypted too? | 🟢 Resolved | Keep plaintext for fast search, but add UI hint that metadata is searchable and not locked. |
| 2 | Should we add a "favorites" system? | 🟢 Resolved | Yes, `isFavorite` added to metadata. |
| 3 | Rich text editor: build from scratch or use `flutter_quill`? | 🟢 Resolved | Use existing `flutter_quill` package. |
| 4 | Multi-directory: should custom dir be read-only or read-write? | 🟢 Resolved | Read-write to enable syncing capabilities. |
| 5 | Any features to cut or add? | 🟢 Resolved | Implement all features as specified. |
