# Release procedure, attestations and reproducibility

How a Fuzzzy Seal release is cut from `.github/workflows/main.yaml`, what the pipeline proves about the
artifacts, what it does **not** prove, and how anyone can check both.

## 1. Cutting a release

Every push already runs the full matrix (`rust`, `flutter-test`, `android`, `linux`, `windows`, `macos`,
`rust-repro` ×2 + `rust-repro-compare`). A release is the same workflow on a `v*` tag, which additionally
runs `attest`.

1. The commit to release is on a branch with a green run. Bump `version:` in `pubspec.yaml` (release
   candidates keep the previous version; only the final tag bumps it) and commit.
2. Tag it — annotated, from that exact commit — and push the tag:
   ```sh
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "fuzzzy_seal v1.2.3"
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```
3. Wait for the tag run (`gh run list --workflow fuzzzy_seal --event push --branch v1.2.3`, ≈ 11 min; the
   Android job is the long pole). Every job must be green — `attest` needs all of them, so a red job means
   no attestation and no release.
4. Download and check everything the run produced (§3), then attach the artifacts and `SHA256SUMS` to a
   GitHub Release (`gh release create v1.2.3 …`). Creating the Release is the publisher's step after the
   owner's go; the pipeline only produces and attests the files.

### 1.1 As run for `v1.1.0` (2026-09-13, from the branch worktree, `agent/chat-harden-rust-crypto-core`)

The bump touches **two** files: `pubspec.yaml` and the Flutter SBOM, which embeds the pub version
(`pkg:pub/fuzzzy_seal@<version>`) — without regenerating it `./sbom.sh flutter --check` fails the `flutter-test` job.

```sh
# 1. bump + changelog + this section, on a green tip (d3b24e3)
sed -i '' 's/^version: 1\.0\.0+1$/version: 1.1.0+2/' pubspec.yaml
./sbom.sh flutter && ./sbom.sh flutter --check                  # SBOM diff must be the version lines only
$EDITOR CHANGELOG.md documents/security/RELEASE.md
git add pubspec.yaml CHANGELOG.md documents/security/RELEASE.md documents/security/sbom/flutter.cdx.json
git diff --cached --check && git diff --cached | grep -iEc 'api[_-]?key|secret|token|password|BEGIN.*PRIVATE'
git commit -F msg.txt                                           # chore(release): v1.1.0 — …
git push origin agent/chat-harden-rust-crypto-core && git ls-remote --heads origin agent/chat-harden-rust-crypto-core
gh run list -R fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" ; gh run watch <push-run-id> --exit-status

# 2. full regression on that exact tip, locally (the same gates CI runs)
( cd rust/fuzzy_crypto_core && cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings && cargo test --locked )
fvm flutter analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings
fvm dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test
( cd rust/fuzzy_crypto_core && cargo build --release --locked ) && fvm flutter test
./sbom.sh rust --check && ./sbom.sh flutter --check

# 3. tag the release commit, annotated, and watch the tag run (ten jobs incl. attest)
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Fuzzzy Seal 1.1.0 — Rust crypto core; see documents/security/HARDENING_2026.md"
git push origin v1.1.0 && git ls-remote --tags origin v1.1.0
gh run list -R fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat --event push --branch v1.1.0 ; gh run watch <tag-run-id> --exit-status

# 4. verify the tag's artifacts once (§3), then delete the download
gh run download <tag-run-id> -R fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat -D rel && cd rel
shasum -a 256 -c sha256sums/SHA256SUMS
for f in android-apk/app-production-release.apk linux-bundle/lib/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so macos-app/fuzzzy_seal-macos.zip; do
  gh attestation verify "$f" -R fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat; done
unzip -p android-apk/app-production-release.apk lib/arm64-v8a/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so | shasum -a 256   # == rust-repro-1/SHA256SUMS android line
cd .. && rm -rf rel
```

The GitHub Release itself (step 4 above, `gh release create`) is created after the owner's go, not by the tag.

Artifacts of a run (`gh run download <run-id> -D rel` puts each one in a directory of its name):

| Artifact | Content | In `SHA256SUMS` / attested |
|---|---|---|
| `android-apk` | `app-production-release.apk` (production flavor, `--split-debug-info`) | the APK |
| `linux-bundle` | `fuzzzy_seal` + `lib/` + `data/` (the whole bundle directory) | `fuzzzy_seal`, `lib/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` |
| `windows-bundle` | `fuzzzy_seal.exe` + plugin DLLs + `data/` | `fuzzzy_seal.exe`, `fuzzy_crypto_core.dll` |
| `macos-app` | `fuzzzy_seal-macos.zip` (`ditto` archive of `Fuzzzy Ink.app`, symlinks and modes kept) | the zip |
| `sha256sums` | `SHA256SUMS` — `sha256sum` lines over the six files above, paths relative to the download directory | — |
| `sbom-rust`, `sbom-flutter` | the CycloneDX SBOMs committed under `documents/security/sbom/` | — |
| `rust-repro-1`, `rust-repro-2` | the Rust core built twice on separate runners + each run's `SHA256SUMS` (§4) | — |

## 2. What is attested — and what is not

`attest` runs `actions/attest-build-provenance` with `SHA256SUMS` as the subject list, so GitHub signs a
SLSA build-provenance statement binding every listed digest to this repository, the workflow file, the tag
and the run that built it (Sigstore, keyless). Verifying an artifact therefore proves *which commit and
which workflow produced these exact bytes* — nothing more.

**Not proven, and stated here so nobody assumes it:**

- **macOS is unsigned and not notarized.** The macOS job builds with code signing disabled
  (`FLUTTER_XCODE_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`): the Xcode project is signed for team `C9387PQ63V` and CI
  has no certificate. Gatekeeper will refuse the app unless the user overrides it. Signing needs an Apple
  Developer certificate as a CI secret or a signing step on a Mac that holds it — an owner decision
  (hardening decision D-3); signed builds come from Codemagic, §6.
- **iOS is not built.** There is no iOS job; nothing in a release is an iOS artifact (signed IPA: Codemagic, §6).
- **The Android APK is signed with a throwaway key.** The `android` job generates a fresh keystore per run
  (`keytool -genkeypair … -validity 1`, `CN=fuzzzy_seal CI throwaway`) because the `release` build type
  refuses to build without one. The APK installs and runs, and is a faithful build of the commit, but it is
  **not a store build**: it cannot update an installation signed with the real key, and the real key is
  never in this repository or in CI until the owner provides it as the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` secrets
  (hardening decision D-6); the store build is signed on Codemagic, §6.
- **Provenance is not a review.** The attestation says who built the bytes, not that the code is correct.
  What the code does is documented in `PROTOCOL.md`; what it defends against, in `THREAT_MODEL.md`.

## 3. Verifying a release

Needs `gh` ≥ 2.49 (`gh attestation`) and `sha256sum` (macOS: `shasum -a 256 -c`).

```sh
gh run download <run-id> -R fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat -D rel        # or download the files from the Release page
cd rel
sha256sum -c sha256sums/SHA256SUMS                               # every line must print OK
gh attestation verify android-apk/app-production-release.apk -R fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat
gh attestation verify linux-bundle/fuzzzy_seal -R fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat
```

`gh attestation verify` fetches the attestation for the file's digest from GitHub, checks the Sigstore
signature and that the signer is a workflow of `fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat`, and prints the workflow, the ref
and the commit it was built from. Compare that commit with the tag: `git rev-parse v1.2.3^{commit}`. Any
file listed in `SHA256SUMS` can be verified the same way; the two crate libraries inside the bundles are
listed so that the Rust core can be checked on its own (§4).

## 4. Reproducibility — honest status

**The Rust core (`rust/fuzzy_crypto_core`) is reproducible; the Flutter app around it is not.** Exactly
what we promise:

1. **Pinned toolchains.** Flutter 3.41.7 (`.fvmrc`, `FLUTTER_VERSION` in the workflow), Rust 1.98.1
   (`rust-toolchain.toml`), `Cargo.lock` and `pubspec.lock` committed and built with `--locked`,
   NDK 28.2.13676358, `cargo-ndk` 4.1.2.
2. **The Rust core builds bit-for-bit identically on two independent machines.** `rust-repro` builds the
   crate twice, on two separate runners with no shared cache, for the host (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
   the linux-bundle target) and for `aarch64-linux-android` (the Android target), `--release --locked`;
   `rust-repro-compare` prints both runs' SHA-256 of `libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` and `.a` and **fails the
   workflow if any pair differs**. It also fails if a runner path survives in the binary (below).
3. **The hashes do not depend on the build machine.** With `strip = true` and no debuginfo, the only
   machine path a release library embeds is `CARGO_HOME` in the panic-location strings of registry crates
   (measured: the crate's own paths are relative, std's are `/rustc/<commit>/…`). `.cargo/config.toml`
   remaps the GitHub hosted-runner homes to `/cargo/registry/src`, so a CI build carries no runner path.
   To reproduce a published hash on your own machine, supply your own mapping (it replaces the config's,
   which is a no-op off the runners) with the pinned toolchain:
   ```sh
   cd rust/fuzzy_crypto_core
   export RUSTFLAGS="--remap-path-prefix=$HOME/.cargo/registry/src=/cargo/registry/src"
   cargo build --release --locked --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu             # the linux-bundle core
   RUSTFLAGS="$RUSTFLAGS -C link-arg=-Wl,--hash-style=both -C link-arg=-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384" \
     cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -P 24 build --release --locked                       # the Android core, NDK 28.2.13676358
   $ANDROID_NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/llvm-strip --strip-debug \
     target/aarch64-linux-android/release/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so                # what AGP does before packaging
   sha256sum target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so \
             target/aarch64-linux-android/release/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so
   ```
   and compare with the `rust-repro-1` artifact's `SHA256SUMS` of the tag run — and directly with the cores
   inside the release: `linux-bundle/lib/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` and the APK's
   `lib/arm64-v8a/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` (`unzip` it) are the same bytes. (`-P 24` is Flutter's default
   `minSdkVersion`, which cargokit passes — cargo-ndk alone would default to 21 and link `pthread_atfork`
   instead of `__register_atfork`; the two `link-arg`s are cargokit's Android link flags, which cargo-ndk
   4.1.2 does not add on NDK 28; the `llvm-strip --strip-debug` is the Android Gradle plugin's packaging
   strip, which only rewrites the section-name table.) (Cargo's portable `[profile.release] trim-paths` would replace the
   remap; it is nightly-only on 1.98.1.)
   Known limits, both measured: **the host matters** — rebuilding the Android core from a macOS host with the
   same NDK, cargo-ndk and rustc gives a different binary (§5), so reproduce on a Linux x86_64 host, which is
   what CI uses; and a macOS `.dylib` additionally embeds the linker's `LC_UUID`, which changes with the
   *target directory path* (two builds into different `--target-dir`s differ in the UUID and the ad-hoc
   signature only; same path → identical).
4. **`SHA256SUMS` + attestations per release** (§2, §3), and the Android release built with
   `--split-debug-info`.

**What we do not promise:** the Flutter AOT output (`libapp.so`, the desktop executables, the app
bundles) is not bit-for-bit reproducible today — it embeds build paths and ids
(dart-lang/sdk#52506; F-Droid rebuilds Flutter apps only by pinning the exact absolute build path). The
Rust core *inside* the shipped Linux bundle and the APK **is** the `rust-repro` build: the `attest` job
extracts both and fails the tag run unless their SHA-256 appear in `rust-repro-1/SHA256SUMS` (the Windows
and macOS cores are attested and path-clean but not gated against a rebuild). The measured relation for
each release is recorded in §5.

The measured result for the first attested tag, `v1.0.0-rc.1`, is in §5.

## 5. Measurements per release

### v1.1.0 (tag → `ec321ed`, 2026-09-13)
Tag run <https://github.com/fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat/actions/runs/34764915646> — ten jobs green, `attest` included;
attestation <https://github.com/fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat/attestations/47176151> (SLSA provenance v1, six subjects,
`sourceRepositoryRef=refs/tags/v1.1.0`, `sourceRepositoryDigest=ec321ed3eb86c4ae70cdc8caf3d4221b4786ffe2`).
Verified once from a fresh download by the publisher: `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` six `OK`; `gh attestation verify`
passed on the APK, the Linux `libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` and the macOS zip; `rust-repro-1` = `rust-repro-2`; and the
`attest` job's own gate printed `shipped linux + android cores == rust-repro` — the first tag on which that gate ran live.

`SHA256SUMS`:
```

```

Rust core, rebuilt on two runners (identical), and the shipped cores:

| Target | File | SHA-256 (runner 1 = runner 2) | Shipped |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` | `ff7131a3dc277d6a4e201283d7b7d803d6b16d251e49deffd0fd45dd93d151ff` | **= `linux-bundle/lib/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so`** |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.a` | `124874111bab4503540c9e65e9d3a747f4c79bb475cb19eae76822dc517549f0` | — |
| `aarch64-linux-android` (API 24, `llvm-strip --strip-debug`) | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` | `e7b3ffa3a2ee57ad132b95b6c1d0c7b65da6fef9d564746f75ee91d46e7a8d31` | **= the APK's `lib/arm64-v8a/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so`** |
| `aarch64-linux-android` (API 24) | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.a` | `5b5a7b284b620ac0a1cc83f3c5231bb02629f512c227d45a04bdfb6043c9400c` | — |

The core hashes differ from rc.1's because the crate changed between the tags (per-chat history key, `hkdf` dropped),
not because the build stopped being reproducible. The Linux `fuzzzy_seal` executable hash is unchanged from rc.1
(`f2974a84…`): the Flutter AOT snapshot lives in `data/`, not in the launcher binary.

### v1.0.0-rc.1
Rust core at this tag (unchanged since the measurement run
<https://github.com/fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat/actions/runs/34719697155>; the tag run re-proves the same values):

| Target | File | SHA-256 (runner 1 = runner 2) |
|---|---|---|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` | `b13462d86d7ebc7abe435dc7fe1ac0938d1f1fd64a6e9adcf59e57e947ea02f6` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.a` | `985795c287f030744259b05ca6c75088792789c9c33f1170e476f61942f96ea3` |
| `aarch64-linux-android` (API 24) | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` | `b8e30d0cfada0e6e55f7b9a37ad960a70fa597918b6b7d126f6523e2d98d6c3a` |
| `aarch64-linux-android` (API 24) | `libfuzzy_crypto_core.a` | `7aa7442eb0caad6688e152af583f09b046c98381d86b13397b4e88d56325a46c` |

- **Linux: the shipped core is the reproducible core.** `linux-bundle/lib/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so`, built by
  cargokit inside `flutter build linux`, is byte-identical to the standalone rebuild above
  (`b13462d8…`), and was already that hash on the previous commit's run — so the attested Linux bundle
  carries a core anyone can rebuild and match.
- **Android: the shipped core is the reproducible core too — established after the tag.** At the tag the
  APK's `lib/arm64-v8a/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so` (`ad625a3a876d1cd3b76d19d368827b0309e12f1fe9f3b28a5f380346d80f2dd3`,
  1,394,568 B) differed from the `rust-repro` rebuild (`b8e30d0c…`, 1,393,664 B) only by a SysV `.hash` section
  (0x340 B) plus its `DT_HASH` entry — cargokit links with `--hash-style=both`, cargo-ndk 4.1.2 does not; `.text`,
  `.rodata`, both relocation tables, `.dynsym`, imports and `.comment` were otherwise equal. With cargokit's link
  flags the rebuild (`626b7041a645beb5317f04c521d227eda5fc97b206508b81d7fa2b84fcb9a85a`, 1,394,576 B) matched the
  APK core in every loaded byte and differed only in the non-loaded section-name table (`.shstrtab` 0xff vs
  0xf4 B, and the section-header offset that follows it): the Android Gradle plugin passes every packaged `.so`
  through `llvm-strip --strip-debug`, which rewrites that table. `llvm-strip --strip-debug` on the rebuild →
  **`ad625a3a…` — byte-identical to the APK core** (verified on run
  <https://github.com/fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat/actions/runs/34721691080>, the first commit after the tag; the
  `rust-repro` job now applies the same strip, and `attest` gates both shipped cores against the rebuild from
  the next tag on).
- **rc.1 evidence caveat.** On the tag run the `rust-repro-compare` step's `diff` was `&&`-chained to an `echo`, which
  exempts it from `set -e` — the step could not have failed on a mismatch. The rc.1 hashes above are therefore
  established by the two `rust-repro-1` / `rust-repro-2` artifacts of the tag run (identical `SHA256SUMS`, `cmp` of the
  Android `.so` = 0 bytes), re-verified by an independent reviewer, not by the gate; the gate is fixed on the commit
  after the tag (`echo` on its own line; mismatch → exit 1 verified with the step script).
- **No runner path in any shipped core**: 0 occurrences of `/home/runner`, `/Users/runner` or `runneradmin`
  in the Android, Linux, Windows and macOS cores of the run; the remapped `/cargo/registry/src` prefix
  appears 88 / 87 / 89 / 334 times respectively (`strings -a`).
- **Host dependence (measured):** the same Android build from a macOS arm64 host (same NDK 28.2.13676358,
  cargo-ndk 4.1.2, rustc 1.98.1, same `RUSTFLAGS` remap) differed from the CI binary in 17,159 bytes
  spread over `.text`/`.rodata`/`.eh_frame`/`.gcc_except_table` at identical section sizes, plus an extra
  `.comment` line from the darwin-hosted NDK clang (`-bolt, -mlgo` build of the same LLVM commit), which is
  what compiles `dart-sys`'s `dart_api_dl.c` — the only C in the crate. Two builds on the same Mac were
  identical. Reproduce on a Linux x86_64 host.

## 6. Codemagic — signed store builds (D-3 / D-6)

GitHub Actions stays the CI (tests, 16 KB gate, reproducibility, provenance). The **signed** artefacts —
a Play-signable Android build, a Mac App Store package, an App Store IPA — come from `codemagic.yaml` at the
repo root: three workflows, `android-release`, `macos-release`, `ios-release`, each pinned to Flutter 3.41.7,
Rust 1.98.1 (installed per build; the images ship none) and triggered by `v*` tags or by hand. **Nothing secret
is in the file**: it names a keystore reference, an App Store Connect integration and two variable groups that
exist only in the Codemagic UI. The file parses (Ruby Psych, PyYAML) and validates against Codemagic's own JSON
schema (<https://codemagic.io/codemagic-schema.json>, 0 errors); it has **not been run** — Codemagic has no
account for this app yet, so the first build is the owner's, after the steps below.

### 6.1 What the owner enters in the Codemagic UI (once)

1. **Add the app** — Applications → *Add application* → GitHub → `fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_chat` (project type
   Flutter). `codemagic.yaml` is detected from the branch you scan. For tag-triggered builds Codemagic needs its
   **webhook** on the repository (app settings → *Webhooks* shows the URL; GitHub → Settings → Webhooks → add it
   for *push* + *tag* events). Manual starts from the UI work without it.
2. **Android upload keystore** — Team settings → *codemagic.yaml settings* → *Code signing identities* →
   *Android keystores*: upload the `.jks`/`.keystore`, enter the **keystore password**, **key alias** and
   **key password**, and set the reference name **`fuzzy_chat_upload`** (the name `codemagic.yaml` lists under
   `android_signing`). Keep an independent copy of the keystore — Codemagic never lets it be downloaded, and
   every later Play release must be signed with the same key. Codemagic exports it as `CM_KEYSTORE_PATH`,
   `CM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `CM_KEY_ALIAS`, `CM_KEY_PASSWORD`; the workflow maps those onto the
   `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH / _ALIAS / _PASSWORD / _PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` names `android/app/build.gradle` reads,
   so the gradle file is unchanged.
3. **App Store Connect API key** — App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API →
   *Generate API key* (role **App Manager**), download the `.p8` (one-time download), note the **Key ID** and
   the **Issuer ID**. Then Codemagic Team settings → *Team integrations* → *Developer Portal* → *Connect*: name
   **`fuzzy_chat_asc`** (the name under `integrations.app_store_connect`), Issuer ID, Key ID, upload the `.p8`.
   Team: **`C9387PQ63V`**.
4. **Variable group `fuzzy_chat_signing`** (app or team *Environment variables*, every value marked *Secret*):
   - `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY` — an RSA-2048 private key in PEM (`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f mac_distribution_private_key -q -N ""`,
     paste the file's content including the `-----BEGIN/END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` lines). `app-store-connect
     fetch-signing-files … --create` creates the *Mac App Distribution* / *Apple Distribution* certificates from
     it in the developer account (or reuses the ones already made from this key), and `certificates create --type
     MAC_INSTALLER_DISTRIBUTION` the installer certificate. To reuse an existing certificate instead, export its
     private key from Keychain Access as described in Codemagic's macOS signing guide and paste that.
   - `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` — only if that key is encrypted.
5. **Variable group `fuzzy_chat_deps`** — `FUZZY_DESIGN_SSH_KEY` (*Secret*): the private half of a **new**,
   passphrase-less deploy key whose public half is added read-only to `fuzzzy-bot/fuzzy_design` (Settings →
   Deploy keys). `fuzzzy_ui_kit` is a git dependency on that private repo; Codemagic adds every `*_SSH_KEY`
   variable to the SSH agent and the workflow routes exactly that URL over SSH. The GitHub Actions deploy key
   cannot be reused — its private half exists only as the Actions secret `FUZZY_DESIGN_DEPLOY_KEY`.
   Alternative: make `fuzzy_design` public and delete the group and the "Route the private fuzzzy_ui_kit
   dependency over SSH" step from all three workflows.
6. **Store records** must exist before a build can be uploaded (Codemagic's note: upload the very first version
   by hand): an App Store Connect app for the macOS bundle id and one for iOS, a Play Console app for the
   Android application id — see the table.

| Platform | Flavor | Identifier (as committed) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | production | `com.fuzzzycore.seal` | `android/app/build.gradle` `applicationId` + `applicationIdSuffix ""` |
| Android | staging / development | `com.fuzzzycore.seal.stg` / `com.fuzzzycore.seal.dev` | same file, suffixes |
| macOS | production | `com.fuzzzycore.seal` | `macos/Runner.xcodeproj` (`Release-production`); `Configs/AppInfo.xcconfig` carries the same id as the default |
| macOS | staging / development | `com.fuzzzycore.seal.stg` / `com.fuzzzycore.seal.dev` | same project |
| iOS | production | `com.fuzzzycore.seal` | `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` (`Release-production`) |
| iOS | staging / development | `com.fuzzzycore.seal.stg` / `com.fuzzzycore.seal.dev` | same project |

### 6.2 What a signed macOS build needs

1. **`com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write`** — added to both `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements`
   and `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements` (D-3 addendum). The app is sandboxed (`com.apple.security.app-sandbox`,
   required by the Mac App Store); without this entitlement a signed, sandboxed build cannot open the file picker
   (`pickFiles`, vault / basics / chat files) or the archive save panel (`saveFile`, F2-10). `network.client` is
   deliberately absent — the app never fetches anything. `keychain-access-groups` (empty, pre-existing) is a
   *restricted* entitlement: it is fine under an Apple-issued certificate, but an ad-hoc-signed local build carrying
   it is killed by AMFI. It is therefore no longer in `DebugProfile.entitlements` (an empty array granted nothing
   anyway); `Release.entitlements`, which the store build signs against, still carries it. The `Debug-*` and
   `Profile-*` configurations sign ad-hoc (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=macosx*] = "-"`, manual style, no profile), so
   `flutter run -d macos` works on a machine with no certificate and no provisioning profile. The `Release-*`
   configurations are untouched: automatic style, `Apple Development`, signed by the workflow below.
2. **Provisioning + distribution certificate** — automatic in the workflow: `app-store-connect fetch-signing-files
   "$BUNDLE_ID" --platform MAC_OS --type MAC_APP_STORE --create` (Mac App Store profile + Mac App Distribution
   certificate), `keychain add-certificates`, `xcode-project use-profiles`. **Default: Mac App Store** — no
   notarization step, no hardened runtime needed; the build is packaged as a `.pkg` signed with the Mac Installer
   Distribution certificate, which is what App Store Connect accepts.
   **Alternative: distribution outside the store (Developer ID).** Change `--type MAC_APP_STORE` to
   `--type MAC_APP_DIRECT` (fetches a Developer ID Application certificate), drop the installer-certificate and
   `.pkg` steps, set `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES` on the Runner target (hardened runtime is mandatory for
   notarization; the project does not set it today), then notarize and staple with the same API key:
   ```sh
   ditto -c -k --keepParent "build/macos/Build/Products/Release-production/Fuzzzy Ink.app" fuzzzy_seal-macos.zip
   xcrun notarytool submit fuzzzy_seal-macos.zip --key "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH" \
     --key-id "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER" --issuer "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID" --wait
   xcrun stapler staple "build/macos/Build/Products/Release-production/Fuzzzy Ink.app"
   ```
   (`notarytool` wants the `.p8` as a file; write `$APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY` to one first.) Both paths
   need the sandbox entitlement above; only Developer ID needs the hardened runtime.

### 6.3 Publishing, and what is deliberately not wired

- Every workflow emails `contact@fuzzzycore.com` on success and failure with the artefacts attached
  (`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/*.apk`, `bundle/**/*.aab`, `Release-production/*.pkg`, `build/ios/ipa/*.ipa`).
  Store upload is **not** automated: once the store records exist, add
  `publishing.app_store_connect: { auth: integration }` (macOS/iOS; add `submit_to_testflight: true` for
  TestFlight) and `publishing.google_play: { credentials: $GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS, track: internal }`
  with a Play service-account JSON as a secret variable.
- iOS has no entitlements file and needs none: `file_picker` and `share_plus` use the system document picker and
  share sheet. The Rust core is built by cargokit for `aarch64-apple-ios` inside `flutter build ipa`.
- The Android job runs the same 16 KB page-size gate as GitHub and seeds the `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` path
  remap with Codemagic's home (`/home/builder`), so no builder path is embedded in the core. Whether the
  Codemagic-built core hashes identically to the tag's `rust-repro` core (same Linux x86_64 + NDK + rustc, so it
  should) is not gated — compare `unzip -p app-production-release.apk lib/arm64-v8a/libfuzzy_crypto_core.so | sha256sum`
  with the tag run's `rust-repro-1/SHA256SUMS` by hand.
- `xcode: 26.5` is pinned to the Xcode this repo was last built with locally (F1-3); move it deliberately.
