# Fuzzy Chat — Threat Model

**Status:** describes the code in `rust/fuzzy_crypto_core` (crate 0.1.0) and the Flutter app around it on the
`agent/chat-harden-rust-crypto-core` branch, format version 1. Its companion is [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md),
which says *what the bytes are and what the code checks*; this document says *what that buys, against whom,
and what it does not*. Every defended claim below names the `PROTOCOL.md` section that specifies the
mechanism and, where one exists, the test that pins it. Where this document and the code disagree, the code
is the truth and this document has a bug — file it (see [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md)).

**Audience:** a security reviewer preparing an audit, and the reader of a MASA / CRA-style assessment who
needs the assets, the adversaries, the controls and the honest gaps in one place. Nothing here restates a
byte layout; those live in `PROTOCOL.md` and are pinned by the vectors in [`vectors/`](vectors/README.md).

**How to read the claims.** A control is stated only if the crate enforces it and a section of
`PROTOCOL.md` describes it. "Test:" names the Rust test (`module::tests::name`, all under
`rust/fuzzy_crypto_core/src/`) or the Dart test file that exercises the property; `cargo test --locked` and
`fvm flutter test` run every one of them in CI on every push. A limitation is stated wherever a control has
one. Nothing in this document is aspirational.

## 1. Assets

What an attacker wants, in the order the product cares about it.

| # | Asset | Where it lives | Protected by |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Message plaintext in transit** (text typed by a user, encrypted into a `Fuzz/` blob) | only inside a `0x03` blob, on whatever channel the users chose | the Olm session's per-message key (§4 below; `PROTOCOL.md` §7, §8, §14) |
| A2 | **File plaintext in transit** | only inside a `0x04` container | a random per-file key sealed in one Olm message + STREAM chunks (`PROTOCOL.md` §9) |
| A3 | **Identity keys of a chat** (one Ed25519 + one Curve25519 key pair per chat per device) and the **one-time key** | inside the Olm `Account` pickle in the sealed state file | the store key (`PROTOCOL.md` §3, §10.3) |
| A4 | **Session state** (the double-ratchet chains — including the current *receiving chain key* — skipped message keys, the counter window) | the sealed state file `<chat_id>.state` | the store key; atomic write, save-before-return (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.3). A copy of this file is the post-compromise asset of §4.3 and §4.5: it decrypts every not-yet-read message on the current receiving chain until a DH ratchet round trip |
| A5 | **The store key** (32 bytes, one per install) | exists in the clear only inside the unlocked process; at rest as a `0x10` wrapped blob in the platform secure storage | Argon2id-derived KEK from the app-lock password (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.2, §11) |
| A6 | **The vault master key** and **vault item content** | `0x10` blob in the Isar vault metadata row; items as `0x20` files | the vault password; sealed items (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.6) |
| A7 | **Local message history** (sent *and* received plaintext) | `StoredMessageData.sealedPlaintext`, one `0x20` seal per row | the local key derived from the store key (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.4) — subject to owner decision D-1 (§8) |
| A8 | **The app-lock and vault passwords** | typed by the user; optionally copied into the OS biometric-gated keystore when biometric unlock is enabled (§2.3) | the OS; the user |
| A9 | **Metadata**: chat names, chat ids, timestamps, message counts and ordering, file names and sizes, the ciphertext blobs themselves, vault item titles/tags/groups/types | plaintext columns of the Isar database | **not protected** — an explicit non-goal (§7.4, `PROTOCOL.md` §10.5) |
| A10 | **Peer authenticity** — that the person at the other end of a chat is the person the user thinks | the safety number (`PROTOCOL.md` §5) | the users' out-of-band comparison |
| A11 | **Availability of history**: that a blob a user already read stays readable | the local seal (A7) | the app lock; the ratchet makes the blob itself single-use by design (§7.6) |

Not an asset of this model: the users' real-world identities (the protocol has no notion of them), the
existence of the app on a device, or the fact that two people exchange blobs (§7.4).

---

## 2. Trust boundaries

### 2.1 The device and the operating system

Everything below assumes the OS, its keystore and the app's process are sound. A compromised OS, a rooted or
jailbroken device with hostile software, a kernel-level keylogger, a screen recorder, a debugger attached to
the process — all of these are **outside** the model (§7.1). The crate is a library inside the app process
and shares its memory; it cannot defend the process from the process.

### 2.2 The FFI boundary (Dart ↔ Rust)

Drawn exactly as `PROTOCOL.md` §13 describes it, and the single most important boundary in the app:

- **Crosses into Rust:** passwords as strings (moved into wiped buffers on the first line of every API
  function), wrapped `0x10` blobs, `Fuzz/` texts and container paths (attacker-controlled input), chat ids
  (shape-validated on entry), plaintext the user typed, output paths, the verified flag.
- **Crosses back to Dart:** ciphertext (`Fuzz/` texts, `0x10`/`0x20`/`0x05` blobs), the plaintext the user
  asked to see, the safety-number string, status enums, progress events, file names, and thirteen
  payload-free error variants (`PROTOCOL.md` Appendix B) — never a key, a path, a digit of a secret or OS
  error text.
- **Never crosses:** the store key, KEK, local key, vault master key, file keys, Olm accounts, sessions,
  message keys, state-file bodies. They live in four opaque handles (`CryptoCore`, `VaultKey`,
  `FileTicket`, `FileJob`) that Dart holds by reference. Every function that touches a key is asynchronous;
  the only synchronous functions (`blob_type_of`, `peek_chat_id`, the `FileJob` controls) touch no key.
  Test: `api::vault::tests::key_never_serialises`; the F4-4 review's whole-tree grep (`PROTOCOL.md` §13,
  and §9 below) found no cryptographic code left in Dart.

What the boundary does **not** do: it cannot wipe Dart's side. A password typed into a text field is a Dart
`String` — immutable, garbage-collected, copyable by the VM — until the process exits, and the bridge's
serialisation buffer that carried it into Rust is freed without wiping (inherent to `flutter_rust_bridge`;
recorded by the F2-2 review). Finding F-8 is therefore closed for **key material** (all of it is in Rust)
and residual for **passwords on the Dart side** (§10, R19).

### 2.3 Platform secure storage

The wrapped store key (`0x10`, ≈ 140 characters of base64) is the only thing the crate needs the OS to keep:
`flutter_secure_storage` key `crypto_store_key_v1` — Keychain on macOS/iOS, Keystore-backed on Android,
DPAPI on Windows, libsecret on Linux (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.1). Its size is far below the smallest known
platform limit (Windows Credential Manager, 2 560 bytes).

Two things the reader must know:

1. **macOS development flavour uses the login keychain**, not the data-protection keychain
   (`lib/src/core/constants/default_constants.dart`: `useDataProtectionKeyChain: appFlavor != 'development'`).
   The data-protection keychain needs a provisioned signature and this project's build machine holds no
   Apple certificate (owner decision D-3); unsigned developer builds would otherwise throw at boot. Staging
   and production builds use the data-protection keychain. A development build's wrapped key is readable
   by any process the same macOS user runs and allows via the keychain prompt (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.8).
2. **Biometric unlock stores the password itself.** When a user enables biometric unlock for the app lock
   or the vault, the *password* is written to a `biometric_storage` entry
   (`lib/src/fuzzy_auth/data/repositories/biometric_auth_repository.dart`, entry
   `fuzzy_biometric_password_<scope>`) that the OS releases only after a successful biometric prompt. The
   crate never sees this: it receives the password as if typed. The consequence is that with biometrics on,
   the strength of the app lock is the strength of the OS biometric gate, not of the password (§4.3, §10 R20).

With the app lock **disabled**, the store key is wrapped under the empty string (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.2): the
wrapping is real but the KEK is public, and the OS keystore is the only protection (§4.3).

### 2.4 The Isar database

The app's database is **not encrypted as a whole** (Isar 3 community build; verified during planning). The
boundary inside it is column-level and the reader must not assume more than this:

| Sealed (ciphertext) | Plaintext |
|---|---|
| `StoredMessageData.sealedPlaintext` — a `0x20` local seal per message (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.4) | `StoredMessageData.encryptedMessage` — the `Fuzz/` blob text (ciphertext, but a record that a message exists, its length and its time) |
| `StoredVaultMetadata.verificationTokenBase64` — the `0x10`-wrapped vault master key (field name kept from the old design; it is no longer a token) | chat names, chat ids, timestamps, message ordering and counts, file names and sizes, chat status, vault item **titles, tags, group and type**, user preferences (the verified flag has no Isar mirror — the Rust flag in the sealed state is the only truth) |

Vault item *content* is not in Isar at all: one `0x20` file per item (optionally wrapped again in a `0x05`
under a per-item password) in the app's files directory (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.1, §10.6).

A copy of the database without the password (and without the OS keystore) is therefore: every message's
ciphertext, every message's *sealed* plaintext (unreadable), and every piece of metadata in the clear (§7.4).

### 2.5 The file system

- **The store directory** `<app support>/fuzzy_crypto_store/` holds one sealed state file per chat, mode
  `0o600` on unix, written tmp → fsync → rename → directory fsync (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.3). Every path under it
  is built from a shape-validated chat id and asserted to stay inside the directory (`PROTOCOL.md` §2). Test:
  `api::pairing::tests::chat_id_is_validated_before_anything_else`,
  `store::tests::crash_between_write_and_rename_leaves_a_stale_tmp_that_is_ignored`.
- **The `.part` contract** (`PROTOCOL.md` §9.3): every decrypted file is written to `<output>.part`, created
  `0o600` only after the header parsed and the key was derived, and each chunk's plaintext is written only
  after its tag verified. Success = fsync → close → rename over `<output>`. Any other exit — error, cancel,
  panic — unlinks the `.part` through a drop guard. Tests: `files::tests::tamper_one_byte_mid_file_no_plaintext_written`,
  `files::tests::tamper_leaves_no_partial_output`, `files::tests::cancel_deletes_part`. The one gap: a
  process **kill** (not a crash the guard can see) leaves the `.part` until the next job over the same
  output truncates it (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.11).
- **Outputs are user-directed.** The receiver chooses the directory; the peer chooses only a bare file
  *name* (no `/`, `\`, NUL, control bytes, `.`/`..`, ≤ 255 bytes; `PROTOCOL.md` §7.3). Test:
  `files::tests::original_name_is_bounded_and_free_of_control_characters`. The name is not display-sanitised
  and an existing output is replaced silently (§10, R14–R15).
- **Two processes on one store are unsupported** (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.10).

### 2.6 The clipboard and the screen

Blobs move by copy and paste. While a `Fuzz/` text is on the clipboard it is readable by any app the OS lets
read the clipboard; the app does not clear it. Plaintext shown on screen is readable by anything that can
read or capture the screen. Both are outside the model (§7.2, §7.3). The app never decrypts a blob
automatically: a message is decrypted only when the user presses send on a pasted `Fuzz/` text
(`lib/src/fuzzy_chat/ui/pages/connected_chat_page/connected_chat_page.dart`, `_sendText`), a file only when
the user picks it. A `fuzzylink://` deep link **prefills** the input field and navigates; it decrypts
nothing (§7.5).

### 2.7 The transport channel — the app has none

Fuzzy Chat has no network code, no server, no directory, no push, no key server (`PROTOCOL.md` §1, §13:
"the crate never reads … the network"). Every blob travels by whatever channel the users choose — SMS,
e-mail, another messenger, a QR code, paper. The model therefore assumes the strongest channel adversary:
**everything on the channel can be read, modified, replayed, reordered, delayed or dropped**, and says
nothing about the channel's own security. The users' choice of channel is theirs.

Deep links (`fuzzylink://invite/…`, `…/accept/…`, `…/fuzz/…`) are an app-layer convenience wrapper around
the same blob — base64 JSON with the blob, a version, a type, and for pairing links a 24-hour `exp` hint
the core never sees (`PROTOCOL.md` §4.6). They are subject to everything above; see §7.4 for what the
message link adds in the clear.

## 3. Adversaries

| Id | Adversary | Capabilities assumed |
|---|---|---|
| **ADV-1 Passive channel observer** | reads every blob ever sent on the channel, forever | harvests ciphertext; correlates blobs by time, size and channel metadata; cannot touch a device |
| **ADV-2 Active attacker on the channel** | ADV-1 plus: modifies, replaces, replays, reorders, drops and injects blobs, including during pairing | the man-in-the-middle case; may run the app themselves and pair with both victims |
| **ADV-3 Malicious peer** | a legitimately paired counterpart | crafts hostile blobs and containers, hostile file names, hostile Argon2 headers; tries to make the victim's device misbehave, consume state, or leak |
| **ADV-4 Device thief** | physical possession of a device, switched off or locked, app not running | in two sub-cases: **without** the app-lock password (and no biometric), or **with** it (or with the victim's finger/face while the OS session is open) |
| **ADV-5 Malware on an unlocked device** | code running as the same OS user while the app is unlocked | reads the app's files and database, the clipboard, the screen; on desktop, the same user's keystore entries |
| **ADV-6 Harvest-now-decrypt-later** | ADV-1 with a future computer | keeps today's blobs to break them when the underlying problems become tractable |
| **ADV-7 Supply chain** | a hostile or compromised dependency, tool, CI runner or release step | ships a build whose bytes are not the reviewed code |

An adversary who controls the victim's OS is not on this list (§7.1).

---

## 4. What we defend, per adversary

### 4.1 ADV-1 — passive observer

- **Confidentiality of every message and file.** Each text blob is an Olm v1 message under a per-message
  key (`PROTOCOL.md` §8.1, §14 step 1); each file's content is sealed under a random 32-byte key that
  exists only inside one Olm message (`PROTOCOL.md` §9.4). Test: `api::messages::tests::round_trip_both_directions`,
  `api::files::tests::chat_mode_round_trip_multi_chunk_both_directions`.
- **Forward secrecy.** A message key is deleted on use and the deletion is persisted before the plaintext
  is returned (`PROTOCOL.md` §14 steps 2–3). A blob captured on the channel and a device state snapshot taken
  *after* the blob was read cannot decrypt it. Tests: `api::messages::tests::forward_secrecy` and
  `api::files::tests::forward_secrecy_for_files` assert `MissingMessageKey` at the **Olm layer**, not merely
  an API refusal (the F2-4 review required exactly this). This is a statement about the *past*: the same
  snapshot decrypts every message not yet read on its current receiving chain until a DH round trip
  (§4.3, R32) — the passive observer never has such a snapshot, which is why it appears under the device
  adversaries and not here.
- **Nothing in the clear on a message blob but the Olm ciphertext**: no chat id, no counter, no sender
  (`PROTOCOL.md` §6.5). The observer learns "a Fuzzy Chat message of this length was sent" and nothing more
  from the bytes.
- **What ADV-1 still gets:** the existence, timing, length and channel metadata of every blob; the pairing
  blobs' public keys and the chat id inside them (`PROTOCOL.md` §6.3–6.4; nothing secret is in a pairing
  blob); and — if the sender used "Copy as link" — the chat id in the message link (§7.4).

### 4.2 ADV-2 — active attacker on the channel

- **Tampered message or file → rejected, no state change.** Every Olm message carries a MAC; every file
  chunk carries a 16-byte Poly1305 tag with the whole container header and the chunk index as AAD; a failed
  check leaves the state file byte-identical and writes no plaintext (`PROTOCOL.md` §7.2 check 3, §9.2).
  Tests: `api::messages::tests::tampered_blob_corrupt`, `files::tests::truncated_mid_chunk_detected`,
  `files::tests::truncated_at_boundary_detected`, `files::tests::appended_bytes_detected`,
  `files::tests::reordered_or_duplicated_chunks_detected`, `api::files::tests::tampered_chat_header_corrupt`.
- **Replay → rejected.** A consumed message key is gone (`Replay` from Olm's `MissingMessageKey`,
  `PROTOCOL.md` §7.2 check 3) and, behind it, the per-direction 64-bit counter window refuses a seen counter
  (`PROTOCOL.md` §8.2). Tests: `api::messages::tests::replay_rejected`, `api::files::tests::replayed_file_rejected`,
  `counters::tests::replay_of_the_highest_is_rejected`.
- **Reordering, dropping, delaying → tolerated within the windows, refused beyond them** (§7.7).
  Tests: `api::messages::tests::out_of_order_within_window`, `counters::tests::out_of_order_within_the_window_is_accepted_then_replay`,
  `counters::tests::counter_below_the_window_is_too_old`.
- **A blob moved between chats or directions → rejected.** The inner header binds chat id, both identity
  keys and direction inside the authenticated plaintext, checked in constant time after decryption
  (`PROTOCOL.md` §7.1–7.2); in practice a cross-chat blob already dies at the Olm MAC. Tests:
  `api::messages::tests::cross_chat_rejected`, `api::messages::tests::wrong_inner_header_is_rejected_without_state_change`,
  `api::files::tests::wrong_chat_rejected_before_any_write`.
- **A tampered pairing blob → rejected before anything is used.** Both pairing blobs are Ed25519-signed
  over every byte including the envelope (domain-separated by the type byte), verified with
  `verify_strict` over the received bytes, before the chat id or any key in the blob is used
  (`PROTOCOL.md` §4.1). Tests: `pairing::tests::signature_covers_the_envelope`,
  `api::pairing::tests::tampered_invitation_rejected`, `api::pairing::tests::tampered_acceptance_rejected`.
- **A replayed or re-signed acceptance → the one-time key survives, the chat completes only once.** Every
  "already used" case is enumerated in `PROTOCOL.md` §4.5; a rejected acceptance never consumes the one-time
  key. Tests: `api::pairing::tests::second_acceptance_rejected`,
  `api::pairing::tests::two_accepters_race_only_the_first_completes`,
  `api::pairing::tests::resigned_acceptance_under_another_identity_rejected`,
  `api::pairing::tests::wrong_inner_header_is_corrupt_and_keeps_the_otk` (eleven dishonest handshake headers),
  `api::pairing::tests::regenerate_invalidates_old`.
- **Man-in-the-middle during pairing → detectable, not prevented.** An attacker who replaces *both* pairing
  blobs holds two sessions and relays. The safety number — a 60-digit (~199-bit) fingerprint of both
  identity keys and the chat id, identical on both sides only if no substitution happened — exposes this
  **when the users compare it out of band** (`PROTOCOL.md` §5, §17.1). Until they do, the chat works and is
  *not* authenticated. The attacker's cost to defeat the comparison is not 2¹⁹⁹: the attacker chooses
  *both* substitute identity keys and needs only a **collision** between the number A sees (over A's real
  key and the attacker's key towards A) and the number B sees (over the attacker's key towards B and B's
  real key) — a birthday search of ≈ 2¹⁰⁰ work over the two grindable inputs (`PROTOCOL.md` §5 "Strength").
  Infeasible, but the reader should carry the right exponent. This is the honest statement of finding F-2's
  closure: the control exists, is real, and depends on a user action. Tests: `api::safety::tests::symmetric`, `api::safety::tests::unpaired_chat_is_unknown`
  (no flag before keys exist), `api::safety::tests::verified_flag_survives_reload` (the flag dies with the keys).
  Low-order Curve25519 points in either pairing blob are refused by vodozemac and reported `Corrupt` with
  no state written (`PROTOCOL.md` §4.3 step 1, §4.4 step 3; F2-3 review, 22/22 degenerate points).
- **A version-2 or unknown-format blob → refused, never guessed** (`PROTOCOL.md` §6.2, §12).

### 4.3 ADV-4 — device thief

**Without the app-lock password** (device off or OS-locked, app not running, no biometric enrolment usable):

- Every state file (identity keys, sessions, skipped keys) and every local seal is XChaCha20-Poly1305
  ciphertext under keys derived from the store key (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.3, §10.4). Tests:
  `store::tests::wrong_store_key_cannot_open`, `store::tests::corrupt_missing_and_foreign_files`,
  `store::tests::tamper_detected`.
- The store key exists only as a `0x10` blob wrapped under `Argon2id(password, m = 64 MiB, t = 4, p = 1)`
  with a random salt, in the OS secure storage (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.2, §11). Offline guessing costs one 64 MiB
  Argon2id run per candidate (≈ 0.12–0.14 s per guess on a 2021 laptop, release build). Tests:
  `store::tests::wrong_password_rejected`, `store::tests::tampered_blob_is_wrong_password_not_a_panic`.
- The vault master key is wrapped the same way in its own AAD domain; vault items are sealed under it
  (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.6). Tests: `vault::tests::wrong_password`, `vault::tests::seal_open_tamper_detected`.
- **Limit — the empty-string wrap.** With the app lock disabled the password is `""`; the thief who can get
  the OS keystore to release the blob (an unlocked OS session, a desktop user account with a known login,
  a development-flavour macOS build) has the store key. The app lock is what turns the OS keystore from
  the only line into the second line (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.3).
- **Limit — biometrics.** With biometric unlock enabled the password sits in the OS biometric keystore
  (§2.3); a thief who can satisfy the biometric prompt has it.
- **What the thief gets regardless:** every plaintext column of §2.4 — who the user talks to (chat names),
  when, how much, and the ciphertext blobs.

**With the app-lock password** (or the unlocked device in hand):

- The thief reads the local history (A7) exactly as the user would, and can send and receive as the user
  in every chat from then on. This is not a cryptographic failure; it is the scope of the app lock.
- **What the ratchet still bounds — past messages.** Blobs the user had already read *before* the theft are
  gone from the state — their keys were deleted on use (`PROTOCOL.md` §14 step 3) — so a blob captured on the
  channel earlier cannot be re-decrypted from the seized state; only the sealed local copy exposes it.
  Unread blobs outstanding at the time of theft are decryptable up to the windows of §7.7.
- **What the ratchet does not bound — post-compromise, until a DH round trip.** A copy of a chat's state
  file (A4) holds the current **receiving chain key**. From it the thief derives the message key of the
  next unread message on that chain **and of every later message on the same chain**, i.e. everything the
  peer sends until the ratchet turns over: the peer must receive a new ratchet key from the victim (the
  victim sends), and the victim must read the peer's reply built on it (`PROTOCOL.md` §8.1, §14 point 3, §17.14).
  Until that round trip happens the copy keeps decrypting new traffic in that direction as it appears on
  the channel — with no action needed on the stolen device. Forward secrecy (the past) holds; post-compromise
  security (the future) needs a round trip and is otherwise **not provided**. No mitigation is in scope for
  this version; it is listed as limitation R32. The sending direction is not affected by the copy in this
  way: the thief can *send* as the victim (below) but reads the victim's own outgoing messages only from
  the sealed local history.
- **Impersonation forward, not backward.** The chat's identity keys are long-lived; possessing them allows
  impersonation in that chat from then on, never the recovery of past message keys (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.13).
  There is no revocation; the peer's remedy is to delete and re-pair, which produces a new safety number.

### 4.4 ADV-3 — malicious peer

A paired peer is trusted with exactly one thing: the plaintext the user chooses to send them. Everything a
peer *sends* is treated as attacker-controlled input:

- **Hostile blobs cannot crash, hang or over-allocate the receiver.** Every decoder reads through a
  bounds-checked cursor; no length field drives an allocation; a short or trailing input is `Corrupt`; no
  input can panic (`PROTOCOL.md` §6.2). Evidence: the F2-1/F2-3/F2-4/F3-1/F3-2/F4-1 reviewer fuzz runs
  (≈ 440 000 mutants across every wire format, zero panics, zero false accepts), plus the committed
  `formats::tests::truncated_payloads_are_corrupt_not_unsupported`,
  `api::files::tests::fuzz_flips_on_the_key_message_never_panic_or_leak`,
  `store::tests::foreign_or_broken_blobs_are_errors_not_panics`.
- **Hostile Argon2 headers are capped.** A pasted `0x05` blob, a received container or a tampered `0x10`
  blob dictates the KDF cost; the decoder refuses `m > 256 MiB` or `t > 16` (and anything `argon2` itself
  rejects) **before allocating a single block**, and all Argon2 runs in the process are serialised by one
  lock taken before the buffer is allocated (`PROTOCOL.md` §11). Worst accepted header: 256 MiB × 16 passes
  ≈ 2 s on a laptop, of the order of ten seconds on a phone, never an OOM (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.9). Test:
  `files::tests::oversized_argon2_params_rejected_before_any_write`.
- **A peer cannot steer the receiver's file system.** The original name is validated as a bare *name* on
  both sides before the counter commits (`PROTOCOL.md` §7.3). The receiver picks the directory.
- **A peer cannot make the receiver spend a message on an incomplete file.** The structural check of
  `PROTOCOL.md` §9.2 step 3 runs before the Olm message is opened, so a header-only or truncated container
  is `Corrupt` with nothing consumed. Test: `api::files::tests::incomplete_container_rejected_before_the_message_is_spent`.
- **A peer cannot re-bind a file key to other chunks or another prefix.** The chunk AAD is the entire
  header, Olm body included (`PROTOCOL.md` §9.4 "Binding"). Test: `api::files::tests::rebound_key_message_is_corrupt`.
- **A peer cannot impersonate the other direction or another chat** (§4.2, inner header).
- **Limits:** a peer *can* make the receiver consume a message on a container whose chunks are then
  corrupt (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.5; §7.8 below) — the file must be re-sent, and the UI says so; a peer can
  choose a file name that looks like another (Unicode direction override) or collides with an existing
  output (§10, R14–R15); a peer can flood the ratchet windows so that the victim's older unread blobs become
  undecryptable (§7.7) — a denial of *old* messages, never a disclosure.

### 4.5 ADV-5 — malware on an unlocked device

Largely a non-goal (§7.1), stated here so the boundary is visible:

- **Defended:** nothing the malware can read from disk is plaintext except the metadata of §2.4; keys never
  cross to Dart and are wiped in Rust on drop (`PROTOCOL.md` §13 "Inside the crate"); there is no logging of
  any secret; the state file body is serialised into an exactly-sized wiped buffer so no partial copy of a
  key is left on the heap by buffer growth (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.3; test:
  `store::tests::state_body_is_exactly_sized_with_full_skipped_key_stores`); the Argon2 block buffer is
  owned by the crate and wiped after each run (`PROTOCOL.md` §11).
- **Not defended:** a process running as the same OS user on a desktop can read the unlocked app's memory,
  the clipboard, the screen and — on Linux (libsecret) and on a development-flavour macOS build — the
  keystore entry that holds the wrapped store key; with the app lock disabled that is the store key. On
  Android the app sandbox and Keystore stop a non-root app; root is a compromised OS. Once the app is
  unlocked the chat store stays unlocked until the process ends: there is **no auto-lock for the chat
  store** (only the vault has an inactivity timer) — §10, R21.
- **Post-compromise, explicitly.** Malware that copies the store directory while the app is unlocked holds
  every chat's sealed state file (A4); it opens them with the store key, which is in the unlocked process's
  memory and — with the app lock off — unwraps from the keystore blob under the empty string.
  As in §4.3: past messages stay unrecoverable (their keys are gone), but each chat's current receiving
  chain key decrypts the next unread message and every later message on that chain until a DH ratchet
  round trip, and the identity keys allow impersonation until the chat is deleted. The exposure is
  therefore not "one snapshot", it is "one snapshot plus the future of every chain it holds until the
  peer's next ratchet step is read on the victim's device". No mitigation in scope (R32).

### 4.6 ADV-6 — harvest-now-decrypt-later

Stated honestly because the product invites it: users are told blobs are safe to leave anywhere, so blobs
sit in inboxes for years.

- **Today's protection:** X25519 (3DH + ratchet), AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 (Olm v1 message layer),
  XChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id, Ed25519, SHA-512. The symmetric layers are not threatened by a quantum
  computer at the parameters used. The **asymmetric** layer is: a cryptographically relevant quantum
  computer breaks X25519, recovers the 3DH secret of a recorded pairing, and with the recorded blobs
  recovers every message key of that chat. Forward secrecy does not help against this — it protects
  against *state* compromise, not against breaking the key agreement itself.
- **No post-quantum component ships in this version.** vodozemac is X25519-only; a hybrid ML-KEM + X25519
  pre-key exchange is a deliberate later project, sequenced after this protocol has been audited so that
  two protocol migrations are never stacked. The clock is NIST IR 8547 (ECC-256 deprecated by 2030,
  disallowed after 2035). This is non-goal §7.9 and residual R22.
- **What the user can do now:** pair over a channel the harvester does not see (the pairing blobs are the
  only thing whose recording matters for this attack; a message blob alone is useless without the session
  secret), and treat long-secrecy content accordingly.

### 4.7 ADV-7 — supply chain

See §9. The short version: every crate, direct and transitive, is fixed by `Cargo.lock` and built `--locked`
(the four protocol crates and the bridge are additionally `=`-pinned); a dependency upgrade that changes
any byte of any format fails the committed-vector test; the Rust core is built twice on independent
runners and the hashes must agree; every release artifact is listed in `SHA256SUMS` and covered by a
GitHub build-provenance attestation; both SBOMs are drift-checked in CI. What this does not prove:
correctness (an attestation says who built the bytes), and the Flutter AOT layer is not reproducible.

## 5. Threat table

Threat → control → where specified → finding of the owner's brief it closes → residual risk or limitation.
Findings F-1 … F-9 are the nine defects the hardening brief opened (§6).

| # | Threat | Control | `PROTOCOL.md` | Closes | Residual / limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Compromise of one device reveals past messages | Double ratchet, per-message keys deleted on use, deletion persisted before plaintext returns | §8.1, §14, §10.3 | F-1 | Sealed local history is as strong as the app lock (D-1, §8); unread blobs within the windows remain decryptable from a seized state (§7.7) |
| T2 | Compromise of one device reveals future messages | Fresh DH on every ratchet step (Olm) — healing happens only when the peer's reply built on the victim's new ratchet key is read on the victim's device | §8.1, §14 point 3, §17.14 | F-1 (past) | **Post-compromise is not provided until a DH round trip**: a copied state file decrypts every later message on the current receiving chain (R32). Identity keys are long-lived per chat: impersonation forward is possible, no revocation (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.13) |
| T3 | MITM substitutes keys during pairing | Ed25519-signed pairing blobs bind each blob to the key inside it; 60-digit safety number over both identity keys + chat id; verified flag cannot pre-date or outlive the keys | §4.1, §5, §17.1 | F-2 | Detection only, and only when users compare out of band; defeating the comparison is a birthday search of ≈ 2¹⁰⁰ over the attacker's two substitute keys (not 2¹⁹⁹); no commitment round, so an SAS scheme would add nothing (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.1) |
| T4 | Ciphertext bound to nothing (re-routing between chats / directions / versions) | Inner header inside the Olm plaintext: version, chat id, sender and recipient identity keys, direction, counter, content type; constant-time key comparison; ordered validation chain that changes no state on failure | §7.1, §7.2 | F-3 | Not in the clear by design (`PROTOCOL.md` §6.5) — the paste target is the open chat; a cross-chat paste surfaces as `Corrupt`, not `WrongChat` |
| T5 | Replay of a captured blob | Olm consumed keys (`MissingMessageKey` → `Replay`) + per-direction 64-bit counter window | §7.2 check 3, §8.2 | F-4 | The window is stricter than Olm (§7.7); a genuine replay is refused before the window is consulted |
| T6 | Reordered / never-delivered blobs break the session | Olm skipped-key store (40 per chain, 5 chains, gap ≤ 2000) + counter window (63 behind the newest accepted) | §8.1–8.3 | F-4 | Product limits: > 40 unread per chain loses the oldest; > 63 behind the newest accepted in a direction is `TooOld` |
| T7 | Tampered file lands on disk as apparently valid output | STREAM: per-chunk 16-byte tag, header ‖ index as AAD, explicit last-chunk flag; plaintext written only after the tag; `.part` unlinked on any failure | §9.1–9.3 | F-5 | Process kill leaves a `.part` (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.11); in chat mode a corrupt chunk has already consumed the key message (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.5; §7.8 here) |
| T8 | Truncation or extension of a file | Last-chunk flag in the nonce; tail `< 16` fails structurally before any output | §9.2 | F-5 | — |
| T9 | Non-standard, non-interoperable cryptography | RSA/OAEP handshake deleted; only audited crates, no primitive written here; every format starts `FUZZ` + version + type | §12, §15 | F-6 | Olm v1 is Matrix's construction with an 8-byte MAC (T15) |
| T10 | Unmaintained vendored crypto fork receives no upstream fixes | PointyCastle fork and every pure-Dart crypto path deleted; `Cargo.lock` + `--locked` (protocol crates also `=`-pinned), `cargo audit` in CI, Dependabot weekly on cargo / pub / actions | §15; §9 below | F-7 | `flutter_rust_bridge` is deliberately excluded from Dependabot and bumped by hand in lockstep (§9.3) |
| T11 | Key material cannot be wiped | Every secret in Rust is `Zeroizing`/`ZeroizeOnDrop`; no `Debug`/`Clone` on key types; exact-size serialisation; wiped Argon2 buffer; nothing key-shaped crosses the FFI | §13, §10.3, §11 | F-8 | Passwords on the Dart side and the bridge buffer are not wipeable (§2.2, R19) |
| T12 | File encryption unusably slow (product defect, and a reason users skip it) | Native STREAM at 576–605 MB/s on an Apple-silicon laptop (release), median 60 / 424 MB/s encrypt / decrypt on an API 35 emulator (profile), versus 1.2 MB/s before | §9 | F-9 | Debug builds ship the crate's dev profile (7 MB/s) — timing only in profile/release; `poly1305` has no NEON backend so the laptop ceiling is ≈ 580 MB/s |
| T13 | Thief reads state files, history or vault from a powered-off device | All local state sealed under keys derived from the store / vault master key; keys wrapped under Argon2id of the password; wrapped blob doubles as the password verifier | §10.2–10.6, §11 | — | Empty-string wrap when the lock is off; biometric copy of the password (§2.3); OS keystore is the floor |
| T14 | Thief or malware reads metadata | none | §10.5 | — | **Non-goal** (§7.4): chat names, timestamps, counts, sizes, blob texts, vault titles/tags are plaintext |
| T15 | MAC forgery against Olm's 8-byte tag | No oracle: every decryption is a human paste; a failed check changes nothing; nothing decrypts automatically; no network to signal success | §17.6; §7.5 below | — | Stated as a known limitation; an untruncated MAC is vodozemac's `experimental-session-config` (R23) |
| T16 | Olm encoding malleability | Inherent to Olm; vodozemac re-encodes what it MACs; only canonically-equivalent encodings of the *same* message are accepted, same key consumption | §17.7 | — | Not a forgery; documented so an "accepted mutant" in a fuzzer is not mistaken for a bypass |
| T17 | Hostile KDF parameters exhaust memory or hang the device | Caps `m ≤ 256 MiB`, `t ≤ 16` checked before allocation; one Argon2 buffer per process | §11, §17.9 | — | Up to ≈ 10 s of CPU on a phone per hostile blob, by the user's own paste |
| T18 | Path traversal via a peer-chosen chat id or file name | Chat id shape-validated at every entry; blob chat ids only ever *compared*; file names validated as bare names on both sides | §2, §7.3 | — | Names are not display-safe; silent overwrite of an existing output (R14–R15) |
| T19 | Unauthenticated `peek_chat_id` used to route a pasted pairing blob | Documented as a routing hint; every operation that acts on the id re-verifies the signature; the Dart side uses it only for a read-only lookup and for deleting a core state that has no database record | §13; F2-7 review | — | R16 |
| T20 | State and message key lost to a crash mid-operation | Atomic write, save-before-return, cache evicted on any failure; a crash between Olm decrypt and write leaves the key → user re-pastes; a crash after the write has already returned the plaintext | §10.3 | — | The app-layer database write after a successful core call is not in the same transaction (R17–R18) |
| T21 | Wrong-type / wrong-role blob accepted under the right password | AAD domains: `store-key` vs `vault-key` for `0x10`; `chat-state ‖ chat_id`, `local-seal`, `vault-item` for `0x20`; the first 31 bytes for `0x05`; storage-only types refused on paste | §6.7–6.9, §10 | — | — |
| T22 | Post-quantum adversary records pairing blobs and messages | none in this version | §17.12 | — | **Non-goal** (§7.9); hybrid ML-KEM is the next protocol project (R22) |
| T23 | A dependency, toolchain or CI runner ships different bytes than reviewed | `Cargo.lock` + `--locked`, committed vectors fail on any byte change, two-runner reproducible Rust core, `SHA256SUMS` + provenance attestation, SBOM drift gates | §12, §15, Appendix A; [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md) | — | Flutter AOT not reproducible; macOS unsigned (D-3); Android CI key is a throwaway (D-6); a build with `--cfg fuzzing` would silently disable signature checks (§9.4) |

---

## 6. The nine findings of the brief

| Finding | Closed by | Deferred? |
|---|---|---|
| **F-1** No forward secrecy (one long-lived symmetric key per chat) | Olm double ratchet via vodozemac; T1–T2; tests `api::messages::tests::forward_secrecy`, `api::files::tests::forward_secrecy_for_files` | No. The *product* consequence (single-use blobs, local history) is owner decision D-1 (§8), implemented per the brief's recommendation |
| **F-2** Unauthenticated handshake | Ed25519-signed pairing blobs + 60-digit safety number + verified flag; T3 | No. The brief named vodozemac's emoji SAS; the build ships a Signal-style safety number instead (owner decision D-2, recorded as reversible; reason in §7.10) |
| **F-3** Empty AAD | Inner header inside the Olm plaintext (chat id, keys, direction, counter, version, content type); AAD on every local and password format; T4, T21 | No |
| **F-4** No replay or ordering protection | Olm consumed keys + per-direction counter window; T5–T6 | No |
| **F-5** File decryption releases unverified plaintext | STREAM chunks, tag before write, `.part` guard; T7–T8 | No |
| **F-6** Non-standard OAEP | The RSA handshake is deleted, not fixed; T9 | No |
| **F-7** Vendored, unsynced PointyCastle fork | Deleted with the whole pure-Dart crypto stack; `rg -i pointycastle` over `lib`, `test`, `pubspec.*` is empty (F4-4 review); T10 | No |
| **F-8** Unwipeable key material | All key material in Rust, zeroised; T11 | Closed for keys; residual for Dart-side passwords (R19) — Dart structurally cannot fix that part |
| **F-9** Pure-Dart bulk crypto ≈ 1.2 MB/s | Native STREAM; measured 576–605 MB/s laptop release, 60 / 424 MB/s emulator profile; T12 | No |

Nothing among F-1 … F-9 is deferred. What *is* deferred is listed as non-goals in §7 and as residual risks
in §10: post-quantum, formal verification of the handshake, iOS/App Store, sealing of Isar metadata, the
archive export and the owner-facing trade-off copy (both gated on D-1).

---

## 7. What we do not defend — explicit non-goals

Each item is a boundary of the model, not an oversight. A reviewer who finds an attack inside one of these
has found a fact we already state, not a finding against the protocol.

### 7.1 A compromised OS or device

Root or jailbreak with hostile software, a debugger on the process, a malicious keyboard, a kernel
keylogger, firmware or hardware implants, a compromised keystore. The crate runs inside the app's process
and trusts the OS for memory isolation, randomness (`getrandom`), file permissions and the keystore
(`PROTOCOL.md` §3, §13). Malware running as the same OS user on a desktop is in this category (§4.5).

### 7.2 Screen capture

Plaintext must be shown to be read. Screenshots, screen recording, shoulder surfing, accessibility services
that read the widget tree — out of scope. The app sets no secure-window flag.

### 7.3 Clipboard sniffing

A blob on the clipboard is readable by any app the OS allows. That is ciphertext (harmless to ADV-1 beyond
metadata), but a *decrypted* message the user copies is plaintext on the clipboard. The app does not clear
or time out the clipboard.

### 7.4 Metadata

The database is not encrypted as a whole (§2.4, `PROTOCOL.md` §10.5). Chat names, chat ids, timestamps,
message ordering and counts, file names and sizes, the ciphertext blobs, vault item titles, tags, group and
type are plaintext on disk. A thief without the password learns *who* (as named by the user), *when* and
*how much*, never *what*. Sealing chat names and vault titles is the same `seal_local` call on more columns —
a documented follow-up, not this build (R11).

Also in the clear, at the app layer only: a **"Copy as link"** message link
(`fuzzylink://fuzz/<base64 JSON>`, `lib/src/core/services/fuzzy_link/fuzzy_link_generator.dart`) carries the
**chat id** next to the blob so the receiving app can open the right chat. The raw `Fuzz/` blob never does
(`PROTOCOL.md` §6.5). A user who shares links rather than blobs gives an observer a stable identifier that
groups every link of one chat. Pairing links additionally carry a 24-hour `exp` hint. This is a product
choice inherited from before the hardening; it is recorded as R12 for the owner.

### 7.5 The 8-byte Olm v1 MAC — and why no forgery oracle exists here

Olm v1 truncates HMAC-SHA256 to 8 bytes per message (`PROTOCOL.md` §4, §17.6). A forgery attack on a
truncated MAC needs an **oracle** that answers "did this ciphertext verify?" quickly and many times — the
classic setting is a server that decrypts on arrival. Fuzzy Chat has none:

1. **The user is the oracle.** The only way a message blob reaches `decrypt_text`, or a container reaches
   `prepare_file_receive`, is a human pasting it into the open chat and pressing send, or picking a file
   (§2.6). Every trial is a human action; the ~2⁶³ expected trials of a blind forgery do not happen.
2. **A failed trial changes nothing and says nothing new.** The Olm decrypt runs on a copy of the session;
   a MAC failure leaves the state file byte-identical and reports the same payload-free `Corrupt` as any
   structural fault (`PROTOCOL.md` §7.2). Test: `api::messages::tests::wrong_inner_header_is_rejected_without_state_change`,
   and the reviewer fuzz runs asserting byte-identical state after every rejection.
3. **A successful MAC forgery still has to pass the inner header.** The decrypted bytes must be a valid
   inner header naming this chat, both identity keys, the right direction and a fresh counter, or the
   result is `Corrupt`/`WrongChat` with no state change — indistinguishable from a MAC failure to anyone
   but the user holding the device.
4. **There is no network to signal anything.** The crate has no network code; the app has no server; a
   deep link prefills a text field and decrypts nothing (§2.6).

**The design rule that keeps this true, stated for every future change:** *no code path may ever decrypt
a message or file automatically on paste, on link open, on clipboard change or on file arrival, and no
code path may report a decryption outcome to anything outside the device.* Adding either would turn the
user-as-oracle argument into a real oracle and would require revisiting this section and, most likely, the
MAC length (R23). Pairing blobs are not affected by the MAC length at all: they are authenticated by a full
64-byte Ed25519 signature (`PROTOCOL.md` §4.1).

### 7.6 Single decrypt — a blob is readable once, on one device

By design (F-1): a message key is destroyed on use. Re-pasting a blob that was already read is `Replay`;
a new device cannot read old blobs; the sender cannot read its own output (`PROTOCOL.md` §14). History
therefore lives in the local seal (A7), which is what D-1 (§8) is about.

### 7.7 The windows — 40 keys, 5 chains, gap 2000, and 63 counters behind

Two independent limits, either of which can refuse a blob first (`PROTOCOL.md` §8):

- **Olm's** (vodozemac's constants, not tunable without a fork): at most 40 skipped message keys per
  receiving chain, at most 5 receiving chains, a message more than 2000 ahead of the chain is refused. A
  peer who generates more than 40 blobs before the other side reads any of them loses the oldest.
- **This protocol's** counter window: per direction, a counter more than 63 behind the newest accepted one
  is `TooOld` even if Olm could still decrypt it. The window is stricter than Olm, never looser
  (`PROTOCOL.md` §8.2 "Parity with Olm"); whether to widen it or make it per-chain is an open product
  decision (R2).

Both are availability limits on *old, unread* blobs; neither ever discloses anything.

### 7.8 A corrupt chat-mode file consumes its message

The file's Olm message is opened — and the ratchet advanced — before the chunks are verified, because the
alternative would keep the message key alive while the file key sits outside the store (`PROTOCOL.md`
§17.5, §9.4). A damaged container must be re-sent; a retry is `Replay`; the UI says so. A cancelled receive
is equally terminal (R13).

### 7.9 No post-quantum cryptography

X25519 only (§4.6). Harvest-now-decrypt-later against the key agreement is **not** defended in this version.

### 7.10 No deniability claims

Pairing blobs are signed with long-lived identity keys and the signatures are kept in the state file for
re-display; a signed invitation or acceptance is a cryptographic proof that a device holding that key
produced it. Olm messages themselves use MACs (deniable in principle), but this protocol makes no
deniability claim and its safety number is a fingerprint of signing keys. (This is also why the brief's
emoji SAS was not used: without a commitment round a two-blob SAS is grindable by an active attacker, and
vodozemac's SAS secret cannot be persisted across the days between invitation and acceptance — D-2.)

### 7.11 Once the user sends plaintext

A user who pastes plaintext into the channel instead of a blob, or who shares a screenshot, or who tells
the peer the safety number over a channel the attacker controls, is outside every control here.

### 7.12 Transport security, multi-device, groups, key rotation, web

- **No transport security claim of any kind** — the app has no transport (§2.7).
- **No multi-device for one user, no group chats** (`PROTOCOL.md` §1).
- **No rotation of a chat's identity keys** — delete and re-pair (`PROTOCOL.md` §17.12).
- **No web build.** `flutter_rust_bridge` generates a web shim, but the app is neither built nor tested
  for the web and no claim is made for it.
- **No anti-forensics.** Deleting a chat overwrites its state file with zeros before unlinking, best effort
  on flash storage (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.3 "Delete"); nothing else is promised about remanence, journaling file
  systems, backups the OS takes, or swap.
- **No post-compromise security beyond what Olm's ratchet gives — and Olm heals only on a round trip.**
  A compromised state file keeps decrypting the peer's messages on the current receiving chain until the
  victim has sent something (carrying a new ratchet key) *and* read the peer's reply built on it; only then
  is a chain the attacker does not hold in use (`PROTOCOL.md` §8.1, §14 point 3, §17.14). The identity keys stay
  compromised regardless and the attacker can impersonate in that chat until it is deleted (§4.3, §4.5, T2,
  R32). No mitigation ships in this version.

---

## 8. The forward-secrecy trade-off — owner decision pending, implemented per the brief's recommendation

The brief reserved one product decision for the owner: what happens to history once blobs are single-use.
The question was asked on 2026-09-11 and is **still pending** on the day this document was written. What
ships is the brief's recommended design (a); the record below is quoted verbatim from the studio's decision
register (`OWNER_DECISIONS.md` in the hardening flow; the `plans/…` paths it cites are internal to that
register, not to this repository).

> ## D-1 · Plaintext at rest (the decision the brief reserved for the owner)
> Full text: `plans/fuzzy_chat_hardening_plan_2026-09-11.md` §B.8. Short form:
> - The ratchet makes every blob single-use: decrypt once, on one device, never again (that is F-1 closed).
> - Sent messages MUST be stored locally regardless (a sender cannot decrypt its own output) — not optional.
> - Recommended (a): store received plaintext too, sealed with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under a per-install key
>   protected by the app-lock password, because Isar 3 is NOT encrypted on its own (verified). Plus a
>   40-message skipped-key window (vodozemac's constant), a password-protected archive export, and plain UI
>   copy that a new device cannot re-read old blobs.
> - Alternative (b): received messages stay ciphertext-only; history shows "unfuzzed once" placeholders.
> **Answer:** _pending_
>
> ## Note for D-1 copy (2026-09-12, from F2-4 review)
> Besides "each blob unfuzzes once, on one device", the history copy must state: a blob more than **63 messages
> behind** the newest one you already read (per direction) can no longer be unfuzzed. Planner may revisit
> Olm-parity later; the core ships the stricter rule.

**What is implemented today** (`PROTOCOL.md` §10.4, §17.3):

- Sent and received plaintext are sealed per row under the local key (HKDF of the store key) and stored in
  `StoredMessageData.sealedPlaintext`; the row also keeps the blob text. A tag failure or a locked store
  reads the row as an empty message, never a throw (`test/src/fuzzy_chat/data/repositories/message_data_repository_test.dart`).
- The sealed copy is exactly as strong as the app lock: no app-lock password means the store key is
  wrapped under `""` and the OS keystore alone protects history (§4.3).
- Design (b) is a small app-layer change (do not call `seal_local` on receive; show a placeholder); the
  protocol is unchanged either way.

**What is not yet implemented and waits on D-1:** the password-protected **archive export** and the
owner-facing **trade-off copy** on onboarding, chat creation and "About encryption" (R10). A reader of this
document should assume the history behaviour above and expect the copy to say: *each fuzzed message can be
unfuzzed once, on this device only; a blob more than 63 messages behind the newest one you already read
can no longer be unfuzzed; a new device cannot re-read old blobs.*

Also pending and relevant to this model: **D-2** (safety number instead of emoji SAS — the build proceeds
with the safety number, reversible), **D-3** (macOS signing), **D-5** (private vulnerability reporting and
the `security@` route), **D-6** (the Android release keystore). D-4 (build fully, then test) is applied.

---

## 9. Supply chain

### 9.1 What is pinned and checked on every push

- **Toolchains:** Rust 1.98.1 (`rust-toolchain.toml`), Flutter 3.41.7 / Dart 3.11.5 (`.fvmrc`),
  NDK 28.2.13676358, `cargo-ndk` 4.1.2 (`RELEASE.md` §4).
- **Dependencies:** the pin that matters is **`Cargo.lock` + `--locked`** on every build, CI and release
  alike — every crate, direct and transitive, resolves to the locked version or the build fails. On top of
  that, `Cargo.toml` carries exact `=` pins for the four crates that implement the protocol (`vodozemac`,
  `chacha20poly1305`, `aead-stream`, `argon2`) and for `flutter_rust_bridge`; the remaining direct
  dependencies (`hkdf`, `sha2`, `zeroize`, `getrandom`, `subtle`, `base64`, `serde`, `serde_json`,
  `thiserror`) are caret ranges fixed by the lockfile. The audited crates and their audits are listed in
  `PROTOCOL.md` §15; `cargo audit` runs in the `rust` job
  ([`.github/workflows/main.yaml`](../../.github/workflows/main.yaml)).
- **Format drift is a test failure.** Twenty machine-generated vectors are committed and
  `vectors::committed_vectors_match` fails `cargo test` if any byte any format produces changes — so a
  dependency upgrade that alters output is a deliberate act, never an accident (`PROTOCOL.md` §12,
  Appendix A; [`vectors/README.md`](vectors/README.md)).
- **SBOMs:** CycloneDX for the Rust crate ([`sbom/rust.cdx.json`](sbom/rust.cdx.json), `cargo cyclonedx`,
  every target) and for the Flutter app ([`sbom/flutter.cdx.json`](sbom/flutter.cdx.json), cdxgen 12.8.4
  from `pubspec.lock`); both committed, both regenerated in CI by `./sbom.sh … --check`, which fails the
  build if the committed file drifts from the lockfiles. An independent reviewer validated both against the
  CycloneDX schema and cross-checked every `Cargo.lock` entry (F5-3 review).
- **Dependabot** ([`.github/dependabot.yaml`](../../.github/dependabot.yaml)) watches cargo, pub and
  GitHub Actions weekly.

### 9.2 Release integrity ([`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md))

- **Reproducible Rust core.** Two independent runners build `libfuzzy_crypto_core` for the Linux host and
  for `aarch64-linux-android`; `rust-repro-compare` fails the workflow if any hash differs or if a runner
  path survives in the binary. The only machine path a release library embeds is `CARGO_HOME` inside
  registry-crate panic strings, remapped by [`.cargo/config.toml`](../../.cargo/config.toml).
- **`SHA256SUMS` and provenance.** On a `v*` tag, every artifact is listed in `SHA256SUMS` and
  `actions/attest-build-provenance` signs a SLSA provenance statement over that list (Sigstore, keyless);
  `gh attestation verify` ties a file to the repository, workflow, tag and run that built it. The pipeline
  is on the branch; the first attested tag (`v1.0.0-rc.1`) is cut by the release procedure of `RELEASE.md`
  §1 and its measurements are recorded in `RELEASE.md` §5 when the tag run completes.
- **What is not proven:** correctness (provenance is not a review); the Flutter AOT output is not
  bit-for-bit reproducible (build paths and ids embedded — an upstream Dart SDK limitation); macOS is
  unsigned and not notarised until the owner provides a certificate (D-3); the Android APK is signed with a
  **throwaway per-run key** and is not a store build until the real keystore is provided as CI secrets
  (D-6); iOS is not built.

### 9.3 The lockstep rule for the bridge

`flutter_rust_bridge` is pinned three ways and must move as one — the Rust crate (`=2.13.0`), the Dart
package (`2.13.0`) and the codegen that wrote `lib/rust_bridge/**` (`codegenVersion 2.13.0`). A mismatch
fails the build; Dependabot cannot group across ecosystems, so **every** bridge bump is excluded from
Dependabot and done by hand with the codegen re-run. The generated bridge is committed; each feature's
reviewer re-ran `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` and confirmed a byte-identical result. There is no
CI gate for codegen drift (R24).

### 9.4 Things a reviewer of the build must know

- **The vendored `cargokit`** (`rust_builder/cargokit/`, the frb 2.13.0 integration template) builds the
  crate from source on every platform and is byte-identical to upstream apart from the integrator's
  prelude comment (F1-2 review). Its own `build_tool/pubspec.lock` is not under Dependabot.
- **Never build with `--cfg fuzzing`.** Under that cfg vodozemac's `Ed25519PublicKey::verify` is a no-op
  and every pairing signature would silently pass. A standing comment at the top of
  `rust/fuzzy_crypto_core/src/lib.rs` records it; no CI job sets it; a reviewer should grep for it in any
  future workflow change (`PROTOCOL.md` §15).
- **The private UI-kit dependency.** `fuzzzy_ui_kit` is a git dependency on a private repository reached in
  CI through a read-only deploy key held as an Actions secret. It contains no cryptography; it is on this
  list because it is the one dependency an outside builder cannot fetch without that key.
- **Android 16 KB page alignment** of the native library is a CI gate (the `android` job), a platform
  requirement rather than a security control, listed so the reviewer does not wonder what the step is.

## 10. Residual risks and open questions

Each item names its source: a `PROTOCOL.md` section, an owner decision, or the independent review of the
feature that introduced or found it (the per-feature review records of the hardening build, kept in the
studio's flow directory; the review ids below are those records).

| # | Residual risk / open question | Source | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **MITM until the safety number is compared.** Pairing authenticates blobs to keys, not to people; detection needs the users to compare 60 digits out of band. | `PROTOCOL.md` §17.1; F2-3 review row 4; F2-5 review §2 | product (UX must keep pushing verification) |
| R2 | **Counter window stricter than Olm** — a blob > 63 behind the newest accepted in its direction is refused although Olm could decrypt it; also the older-chain case. Widen, or make per-chain? | `PROTOCOL.md` §8.2, §17.2; F2-4 review N1 | planner |
| R3 | **D-1 pending.** Received plaintext is sealed locally per the recommendation; the owner has not answered. | §8; `PROTOCOL.md` §17.3 | owner |
| R4 | **The empty-string wrap.** With the app lock off, the OS keystore alone protects the store key. | `PROTOCOL.md` §10.2, §17.3 | product (copy must say so) |
| R5 | **Isar metadata in plaintext**, including vault item titles/tags/group/type and the blob texts. | `PROTOCOL.md` §10.5; F5-1 log §5 | follow-up: seal more columns |
| R6 | **8-byte Olm v1 MAC.** No oracle exists today (§7.5); the guarantee is a design rule, not a cryptographic one. An untruncated MAC exists as vodozemac's `experimental-session-config` (`SessionConfig::version_2()`), off by default and not enabled here. | `PROTOCOL.md` §17.6; hardening plan §H (internal) | audit question (R23) |
| R7 | **Olm encoding malleability** — canonically-equivalent encodings of one message are accepted (same plaintext, same key consumption). | `PROTOCOL.md` §17.7; F2-3 review row 8; F2-4 review row 7 | none (inherent) |
| R8 | **The file-key message is not bound to `chunk_size` / `nonce_prefix` at prepare time** — any single-bit change to the 24 non-Olm header bytes passes `prepare_file_receive`, consumes the message, and only then fails at chunk 0 (AAD). Folding those fields into the `0x02` body would refuse before spending the step, at the price of a layout change. | `PROTOCOL.md` §9.4 "Binding"; F3-2 review §2 (2 209 header variants) and N5 | planner (format v2 candidate) |
| R9 | **Corrupt or cancelled chat-mode file consumes its message** — terminal for that container. | `PROTOCOL.md` §17.5; F3-2 review §3/N4; F3-3 review N2 | product copy |
| R10 | **Archive export and trade-off copy not built** (gated on D-1). Until then history leaves the app only by copying messages. | backlog F2-10 / F2-11; §8 | owner → developer |
| R11 | **`getMessagesForChat` degrades on a locked store**: every text row reads as an empty string with a logged warning; `MessageData` carries no "unreadable" marker. Harmless in the UI (the boot gate keeps chats unreachable until the store opens) but an archive export must gate on the store being open or it would silently write empty messages. | F2-8 review §8 | developer of F2-10 |
| R12 | **The "Copy as link" message link carries the chat id in the clear**; pairing links carry `exp`. The raw blob does not. Decide whether message links should drop `c` (the paste target is the open chat) or accept the identifier. | §7.4; hardening plan §H (internal) rule "no chat id in the clear without a threat-model note" | owner |
| R13 | **A cancelled chat receive** shows no failure reason, and the next attempt on the same container reads "already unfuzzed". | F3-3 review N2 | product copy |
| R14 | **Peer-chosen file names are not display-safe** (a Unicode direction override is a valid name); the UI shows the *input* name today. | `PROTOCOL.md` §7.3; F3-2 review N1; F3-3 review §1 | product |
| R15 | **Output collisions overwrite silently** (`<chat>/<originalName>`), and the name is now peer-chosen. | `PROTOCOL.md` §9.3; F3-3 review N3 | product |
| R16 | **`peek_chat_id` is unauthenticated** by design; the Dart side uses the peeked id for a read-only lookup and — only when no database record exists — to delete an orphaned core state before re-accepting. A crafted invitation naming an id this device holds hits the own-invitation guard. | `PROTOCOL.md` §13; F2-7 review §2 | none (documented) |
| R17 | **Handshake half-commit window**: the core persists `complete_handshake` before the database record is updated; a kill between them leaves the record "invited" while the core is connected, and every retry is `InvitationAlreadyUsed` until the chat is deleted and re-paired. Recoverable; one chat wide. | F2-7 review nit 2 | developer (reconcile from `chat_status` at chat open) |
| R18 | **Seal failure on write stores the row with a null seal** — reachable only if the store closes between `decrypt_text` and `seal_local`; today nothing closes the chat store while a chat is open. | F2-8 review §2 | none today; revisit with R21 |
| R19 | **Passwords on the Dart side are not wipeable** (Dart `String`; the bridge's serialisation buffer is freed unwiped). Key material is unaffected. | §2.2; F2-2 review nits; brief F-8 | none (language limit) |
| R20 | **Biometric unlock stores the password** in the OS biometric keystore; the app lock is then as strong as the OS biometric gate. | §2.3 | product copy |
| R21 | **No auto-lock and no manual lock for the chat store** once unlocked at boot; only the vault has an inactivity timer. | §4.5; F2-8 review §2 (`lock()` has no caller) | product |
| R22 | **No post-quantum component**; harvest-now-decrypt-later on the X25519 key agreement is undefended. Hybrid ML-KEM + X25519 on the pre-key exchange is the next protocol project, after this one is audited. | §4.6, §7.9; `PROTOCOL.md` §17.12 | owner (sequencing) |
| R23 | **Open audit question — MAC length.** Should a format version 2 adopt vodozemac's untruncated-MAC session config, given that the oracle argument rests on a product rule rather than on the primitive? | §7.5; R6 | auditor → owner |
| R24 | **No CI gate for bridge-codegen drift** — reviewers re-run the generator per feature; a stale `lib/rust_bridge/**` would be caught by a human, not a job. | §9.3 | ops |
| R25 | **Argon2id cost on low-end devices.** Unlock ≈ 1.0 s on an API 35 arm64 emulator (release core), ≈ 0.13 s on an Apple-silicon laptop; a hostile-header worst case of ≈ 10 s on a phone; debug builds ship the crate's dev profile and take ≈ 10 s per KDF. The parameters (`m = 64 MiB`, `t = 4`) are data, not format, so a later build may tune them without a version bump. | `PROTOCOL.md` §11, §17.9; F2-6 QA; F4-1 review | product (measure on real low-end hardware) |
| R26 | **Windows secure-storage size limit** is not an issue for the ≈ 140-character wrapped blob (limit 2 560 bytes) but it is the reason nothing larger must ever be stored there. | hardening plan §B.6 (internal) | none (documented) |
| R27 | **macOS development flavour uses the login keychain**; staging/production use the data-protection keychain. Never ship the development flavour. | `PROTOCOL.md` §17.8; D-3 | ops |
| R28 | **Release signing:** Android CI key is a throwaway, macOS unsigned, iOS not built. | `RELEASE.md` §2; D-3, D-6 | owner |
| R29 | **Disclosure surface incomplete:** GitHub private vulnerability reporting not yet enabled; `security@` route not yet confirmed (`contact@` is the working address); `security.txt` not yet served on the website. | D-5; `SECURITY.md` | owner / ops |
| R30 | **Two processes on one store** are unsupported; `.part` files survive a process kill. | `PROTOCOL.md` §17.10–17.11 | none (documented) |
| R31 | **Pairing has no timeout**: a pending chat keeps its account and one-time key until accepted, regenerated or deleted; the link-level `exp` is a hint the core never checks. | `PROTOCOL.md` §4.6 | product |
| R32 | **No post-compromise security until a DH round trip.** A copied state file (thief with the password, malware on an unlocked device, a backup the OS took) holds the current receiving chain key of each chat and decrypts every later message the peer sends on that chain until the victim sends and then reads the peer's reply. Past messages stay protected (forward secrecy). No mitigation in scope; candidates (forcing a ratchet step on every send, or re-keying on unlock) are a protocol change for a later version. | `PROTOCOL.md` §8.1, §14 point 3 (verified against the crate: a copy of B's state opened three later messages until B replied and read A's answer), §17.14; F5-1 security audit finding M1 | planner (format v2 candidate); product copy |

## 11. What an audit should focus on

In descending order of what a finding would be worth to the product. Everything else in this document has
either been independently re-derived (vectors, goldens) or fuzzed by a reviewer at least once; these are the
places where a fresh pair of eyes changes the risk.

1. **The post-compromise window (R32) and the user-as-oracle argument (§7.5).** For R32: confirm from
   vodozemac's receiver-chain code how long a copied chain key stays live under realistic paste-messenger
   traffic (the victim may read many peer messages before ever replying), and whether the product should
   force a ratchet step or re-key on unlock in a later format. For §7.5: confirm there is no code path —
   deep link, clipboard listener, file watcher, share sheet, notification — that decrypts without a user
   action, and no path that reports an outcome off the device; then take a position on R23: is a product
   rule an acceptable basis for an 8-byte MAC, or should format version 2 move to the untruncated session
   config?
2. **The validation chain order (`PROTOCOL.md` §7.2) and the "no state change on failure" invariant.**
   `with_state_mut` + save-before-return is the property every replay and forward-secrecy claim rests on.
   Read `store.rs` `with_state_mut`, `messages.rs` `decrypt_payload`, `pairing.rs` `complete_handshake` and
   the file `prepare_*` pair; try to construct an input that mutates cached or on-disk state before the
   last check passes.
3. **Pairing and the safety number (`PROTOCOL.md` §4–5).** The signature domains, the ordered checks, what
   the handshake header binds, whether the number transitively pins every 3DH input as §5 claims, and the
   two-leg collision bound (≈ 2¹⁰⁰, §4.2). Formal modelling of this handshake in Tamarin is a planned
   follow-up; an auditor's informal attack search here is the next best thing.
4. **The file-key binding gap (R8)** and whether it should be closed in the format rather than at the AAD.
5. **The local-state key hierarchy (`PROTOCOL.md` §10–11).** Store key → local key (HKDF) and the AAD
   domains; the vault master key; the empty-string wrap; the caps on attacker-controlled Argon2 headers;
   the single Argon2 lock taken before allocation.
6. **The FFI boundary (`PROTOCOL.md` §13).** Grep the generated `lib/rust_bridge/**` for anything
   key-shaped; confirm every function touching a key is asynchronous and every opaque handle is held by
   reference only (a by-value opaque parameter would panic in frb's owned decode).
7. **Zeroization on the Rust side** — including the exact-size serialisation of pickles (`state.rs`) and
   the wiped Argon2 buffer — and an honest statement of what the Dart side cannot wipe (R19).
8. **Metadata (§7.4, R5, R12)** — whether the plaintext columns and the chat id in message links are
   acceptable for the product's threat population.
9. **The windows (§7.7)** — whether 40 / 5 / 2000 / 63 match how people will actually use a paste-based
   product, and whether `TooOld` and `Replay` are surfaced clearly enough that a user does not mistake a
   window limit for tampering.
10. **The supply chain (§9)** — reproduce the Rust core hash from the published procedure, verify one
    attestation, diff the SBOMs against the lockfiles, and check no workflow ever sets `--cfg fuzzing`.

What an audit should **not** spend time on: the byte layouts (pinned by vectors and re-derived
independently in Python by every feature's reviewer), the deleted pure-Dart stack (gone, grep-verified), and
the primitives themselves (vodozemac, RustCrypto AEADs and password-hashes — already audited, see
`PROTOCOL.md` §15).
